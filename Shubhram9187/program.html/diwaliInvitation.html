            <p>Diwali, known as the Festival of Lights, is one of the most celebrated and cherished festivals in India. It symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. Families and friends gather to light lamps, decorate their homes with rangoli, exchange sweets, and burst fireworks. Itâ€™s a time of joy, unity, and renewal, where prayers are offered to Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, and homes are cleaned and adorned to welcome her blessings.
