It is the eighth-largest state by area, and the eleventh-largest by population, with over 41 million inhabitants. The state also has the third-largest population of Scheduled Tribes in India.[21] It neighbours the states of Jharkhand and West Bengal to the north, Chhattisgarh to the west, and Andhra Pradesh to the south.

    The ancient kingdom of Kalinga, which was invaded by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka in 261 BCE resulting in the Kalinga War, coincides with the borders of modern-day Odisha.[25] The modern boundaries of Odisha were demarcated by the British Indian government, the Orissa Province was established on 1 April 1936, consisting of the Odia-speaking districts of Bihar and Orissa Province, Madras Presidency and Central Provinces.[25] Utkala Dibasa (lit. 'Odisha Day') is celebrated on 1 April.[26] Cuttack was made the capital of the region by Anantavarman Chodaganga in c. 1135,[27] after which the city was used as the capital by many rulers, through the British era until 1968. Thereafter, Bhubaneswar became the capital of Odisha.[28]
