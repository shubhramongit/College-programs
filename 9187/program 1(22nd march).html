        <dt><b>Don’t I need a development environment to work with JavaScript?</b>
    </dt>
     <dd><br>
        Nope. As with HTML, all you need is a text editor and a browser
        that supports JavaScript. You might be confusing JavaScript with Java, a more comprehensive programming language that needs at least a compiler for its programsto run.
             However, tools like FireBug for Firefox, the Internet Explorer Developer
             Toolbar,   and Safari's Web Inspector can make your life easier. Consult the
             documentation
             on those tools to learn more about their JavaScript features.</dd><br>
             <dt><b>What is AJAX?</b></dt><br>
         <dd>One topic we haven't covered yet is AJAX. AJAX is a term used to
             describe scripts that communicate with the server without requiring a Web page to
             be
             fully reloaded. For example, you can use it to fetch information and
             display it
             on the page, or to submit a form for processing, all without changing the
             full
             page in the browser. I'll discuss AJAX in detail in Lesson 16, “Using
             JavaScript Libraries.”</dd><br>
             <dt><b>When I use JavaScript, do I need to accommodate users whose
             browsers may
             not support JavaScript or who have disabled it?</b></dt><br>
             <dd>Some estimates indicate that over 90% of Web users have JavaScript
             enabled. However, unless you have a really good reason not to, you should
             make
             accommodations for users without JavaScript. You need not offer users who
             don't
             have JavaScript an identical experience to those who have it, but they
             should be
             able to access your site. For example, if you run an online store, do you
             really
             want to shut out users because of their browser configuration? </dd>
